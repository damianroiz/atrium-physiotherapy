							<h2 id="physiotherapy">Physiotherapy</h2>
											<p>	Our physiotherapists are highly-educated experts in physical function, movement and mobility. They have advanced knowledge of how the human body moves and what stops it moving and use specialized hands-on treatment to restore, maintain and maximize optimal function and quality of life.<br><br>

												Our physiotherapists assists, diagnose and treat physical symptoms and limited movement caused by injury, aging, disability, or medical condition. They help patients understand what’s causing their condition, and work with them to restore, maintain and maximize movement, flexibility and physical independence.<br><br>
												
												Our physiotherapists develop customized treatment plans that help patients take back control. They teach patients how to restore, maintain and/or maximize movement, reduce pain, and manage any chronic symptoms.<br><br>
												
												Our physiotherapists excel in the treatment of many conditions: back pain/injury, whiplash, pregnancy-related muscle/joint issues, urinary incontinence and vertigo to name a few. They also help patients manage symptoms of chronic conditions like arthritis and chronic pain.<br><br>
												
												Our physiotherapists help patients who may have otherwise tried temporary (e.g., prescription drugs) or more invasive methods (e.g., surgery) to manage their condition. They use individualized therapeutic exercise, manual therapy and other treatment techniques.<br><br>
												
												Through physiotherapy, many patients are able to recover unrestricted movement which promotes the kind of physical independence necessary for a normal lifestyle and work. When it comes to assessing and treating people with movement problems, the services of a physiotherapist are often essential.</p>

												<h3>What Can I Expect During My First Appointment?	</h3>
												<p>
														On arrival, you may be asked to fill out paperwork or complete medical history forms. Your physiotherapist will then conduct a detailed assessment of your problem or condition. This takes about 30-45 minutes and normally involves:
													<ul>
													<li>	Where you are having the problem</li>
													<li>How the problem started</li>
													<li>	How the problem is affecting your ability to do daily activities</li>
													<li>	Your past medical history</li>
													<li>	Any medications you are taking</li>
													<li>	Your physiotherapist may also need to ask additional questions depending on your problem or condition.</li>
													</ul>
														A detailed physical examination includes:
														<ul>
													<li>	Checking your posture</li>
													<li>	Examining range of motion</li>
													<li>	Testing muscle strength, ligaments, tendons, and nerves</li>
													</ul>
														Your physiotherapist may also check your balance, walking or how much you can lift or carry. Once the assessment is complete, your physiotherapist will explain what is causing the problem and discuss a physiotherapy treatment program.<br><br>
													
														You will then be asked to give consent to the treatment program. Before giving consent, make sure you fully understand the treatment plan. Ask if you need clarification. Your physiotherapist will explain the treatment plan in more detail.

	              			<p>Massage Therapy involves gentle hands-on manipulation of the soft tissues of your body. Therapeutic massage focuses on your muscles, connective tissue, tendons, ligaments and joints. Atrium Physiotherapy Registered Massage Therapists manipulate your muscles and other soft tissues of the body with varying degrees of pressure and movement. This helps to relieve pain and tension. If done soon enough after accidents involving trauma and injury, massage can greatly reduce the development of painful muscular patterning.<br><br>

													Massage Therapy is more than a period of relaxation, the therapeutic message helps diminish physical problems caused by stress, back pain, loss of energy, insomnia, etc. Massage can bring physical, mental and emotional changes. The benefits can vary from individual to individual.</p>

												<img  src="images/clinical_laser.jpg" style='max-width:100%;'>
												</div>
	              			<p>Laser Therapy uses red and infrared light for the relief of pain, to accelerate healing and decrease inflammation. When the light source is placed against the skin, the photons penetrate several centimeters and get absorbed by the mitochondria, the energy producing part of a cell. This energy fuels many positive physiological responses resulting in the restoration of normal cell morphology and function. Laser Therapy has been successfully used to treat a broad range of medical conditions, including musculoskeletal problems, arthritis, sports injuries, post-surgical wounds, diabetic ulcers and dermatological conditions.

												<h2>What is Functional Dry Needling/Intramuscular Stimulation (IMS)?</h2>
												<p>
													Dry Needling is a valuable, effective and efficient adjunct treatment to inactivate myofascial trigger points. 
													It is an invasive procedure in which a thin solid filament sterile needle is used. Dry Needling involves insertion 
													and repetitive manipulation of the needle in the myofascial trigger point. The purpose of this technique is to inactivate
													 the myofascial trigger points by producing a local twitch response. This local twitch response then releases the shortened
														bands of muscle fibers. The result is muscle relaxation and pain relief. Eliciting this local twitch response is important 
														for successful deactivation of the trigger point. No medication of any kind is injected. Inactivation of the trigger points
														 can bring immediate relief of symptoms. <br><br>
														
														 <img src='images/ims1.jpg' class="service-img"><br>

														 <h3>What is Myofascial Trigger Point?</h3>
														 A myofascial trigger point is a hyperirritable spot in a muscle which is located in
															a taut (tight) band and is painful to touch. This hypersensitive spot or nodule (the “knot”),
															 can give characteristic referred pain, referred tenderness and other referred symptoms in areas 
															 other than where the muscle is located. (Travel and Simons in Myofascial Pain and Dysfunction: The
																Trigger Point Manual). Janet Travell, MD first described the existence of trigger points in the 1940’s. <br><br>
																
																
														 <h3>Advantages of Dry Needling</h3>
														 The advantages of dry needling over other treatments are that we can treat parts of the muscle, and deeper layers of muscles, which our hands and fingers cannot reach. Also, this method is far superior in achieving a 
														 local twitch response over other manual techniques. In addition, there are no drugs used so we can treat many trigger points during each treatment. <br><br>

														 <h3>How is this different from Traditional Acupuncture?</h3>
														 Dry Needling must not be confused with any type of acupuncture. Whereas acupuncture is founded on Traditional Chinese Medicine (Dry Needling is based on 
														 Western anatomical and physiological principles. It is founded by scientific concepts and it continues to evolve using the latest research.	<br><br>
														
														
														 <h3>Treatment Approach</h3>
														 Dry Needling is not a stand-alone treatment by itself. It is always done in conjunction with other manual and physical therapy treatments, 
														 such as exercises, postural training, education and other hands on techniques like soft tissue work and manipulation. Since full pain free 
														 range of motion is the ultimate goal of myofascial treatments, we teach the muscles the right away to work in their newly-gained pain free 
														 range to restore their normal function. It is important that you are an active participant in your 
														 own treatments and well being. Therefore you must follow through with your home exercise program which we will establish specifically for you.	<br><br>
													
													
														 <h3>Treatment Frequency</h3>
														 Typically, we will use Dry Needling once a week to inactivate the trigger points and you will have
														  one or two more treatments that week to work on other aspects of your condition.<br><br>
														 There is no specific, predetermined number of treatments for patients with myofascial pain.
															Chronic conditions will require more treatments than acute conditions. In addition, the amount of 
															treatments will also depend on concurrent other medical conditions, your compliance with the exercises, your age and physical condition. 
															 <br><br>
														
															 <h3>Side Effects & Risks</h3>
															 The commonest side effects of FDN include temporary increase in pain which can last from a couple
																of hours to several days, followed by an expected improvement in the overall pain state. This increase
																 in pain is mainly caused by the “twitching” of the muscles. It is also related to over activity of the 
																 shortened muscle bands that have not been released, or sometimes there is a temporarily increased spasm of the treated muscles. <br><br> 
															 The most serious risk with FDN is accidental puncture of a lung (pneumothorax).  This can only happen if the needle
																is placed too closed to the chest/lung fields. If this were to occur, it may likely require a chest x-ray and no further treatment. 
																 The symptoms of shortness of breath may last for several days to weeks.  A more severe puncture can require hospitalization 
																 and re-inflation of the lung.  This is a rare complication, and in skilled hands it should not be a major concern.   <br><br>
															 Other less serious risks include infection and bruising: Any time a needle is used there is a risk of infection.
																However, your practitioner uses new, disposable and sterile needles, and is trained to the highest level of aseptic skin preparation 
																and needle insertion technique. Therefore, infections are extremely rare. Injury to a blood vessel causing a bruise, and/or nerve injury
																 may also occur.  Bruising is a common occurrence and should not be a concern.

												<h2>Acupuncture</h2>
												<p>
													Acupuncture is an ancient form of Chinese medicine involving the insertion of ultra-fine needles into specific points of the skin. 
													These points of energy are located along 14 meridians, or channels, that cover the entire body. Using modern techniques, contemporary 
													medical acupuncture is able to precisely stimulate nerves to modulate pain and other dysfunctions.<br><br>
													<img src='images/acupuncture.jpg' class="service-img"><br>
													Whether there is a presence of a medical condition or not, everybody can benefit from acupuncture due to its homeostatic effects, 
													which help the body regain balance and function at a more optimal level. Acupuncture has an array of health benefits; it can:
													<ul>
														<li>Improve circulation</li>
														<li>Improve digestion</li>
														<li>Increase relaxation</li>
														<li>Release natural pain killers</li>
														<li>Increase energy</li>

												<h2>Graston Technique ®</h2>
												<p>
													Graston technique is a form of instrument-assisted or augmented soft tissue mobilization (ASTM) that enables practitioners to improve scar tissue,
													 fascial restrictions and range of motion. The theory behind this IASTM technique is that by using a tool to introduce microtrauma into an area 
													 of excessive scarring and/or soft tissue fibrosis, an inflammatory response will occur. In a 2017 Journal of Exercise Rehabilitation study, 
													 the authors describe that “Such inflammation restarts the healing process by removing the scar tissue and releasing adhesions, while also 
													 increasing blood and nutrient supply to the injured area and migration of fibroblasts.” (1b) <br><br>
													The use of tools helps to get to the root of the problem, but it’s also intended to reduce stress on the therapist’s hands. 
													Graston technique allows a practitioner to get deep into the problematic tissue yet be sensitive to a patient’s level of pain 
													tolerance. As the instruments are moved over the affected area and come in contact with adhesions, they help to break up scar 
													tissue dysfunction and restrictions of the fascia.<br><br>
													<img src='images/Graston.jpg' class="service-img"><br>
													In time, this process can reduce or eliminate the adhered fibers, restoring range of motion and eliminating the associated pain. 
													The aim and ideal outcome of Graston technique is to help transform your soft tissue injury into healthy functioning tissue once again.<br><br>
													Why does Graston technique aim to reduce scar tissue? Scar tissue is thick, dense tissue that appears after injury or trauma. It can
													 limit your range of motion, cause pain and lead to dysfunctional movement. Graston technique aims to break up this scar tissue to interrupt
													  and break the cycle of pain and dysfunction.<br><br>
													Graston technique is never used completely on its own. The full treatment includes brief warm-up exercises, Graston technique treatment, 
													followed by stretching and strengthening activities. Ice can also be a part of the follow-up portion of treatment if subacute inflammation 
													(inflammation that lasts longer than acute inflammation but is not chronic) is present.<br><br>
													This noninvasive method of healing known as Graston technique or instrument-assisted soft tissue mobilization (IASTM) is used to
													 treat all kinds soft tissue conditions, whether they are chronic, acute or post-surgical. You may have never heard of Graston technique 
													 before, but other people have, like the 431 professional and amateur sports organizations currently utilizing Graston technique on a regular
														basis. (1a) Clearly, some of the most physically active and frequently injured people on the planet must be feeling the relief of this healing
														 technique!<br><br>

														 <ul>
																Graston® technique can be used to treat:
															 <li>Tennis elbow (lateral epicondylitis)</li>
															 <li>Golfer's elbow (medial epicondylitis)</li>
															 <li>Scar Tissue</li>
															 <li>Foot pain (plantar fasciitis)</li>
															 <li>Knee pain (patellofemoral disorders)</li>
															 <li>Fibromyalgia/li>

												<h2>Triton Spinal Decompression</h2>
												<p>

														<img src='images/tritonSpinal.png' class="service-img"><br>
										
														Spinal Decompression is a non-surgical and drug-free answer for disc related problems of the lumbar or cervical spine. Many
														 people across the country and around the world have found relief from the pain associated with herniated discs, bulging discs,
															facet syndrome, degenerative joint disease, pinched nerves, and other spinal afflictions from decompression therapy. Spinal Disc 
															Decompression uses computer-aided technology to apply gentle, non-surgical decompression to your 
														spine which increases circulation into the spinal discs and joints, thus helping to relieve the symptoms that cause pain and dysfunction.	<br><br>
												 
										
													<h3>How does Spinal Decompression work?</h3>
													<img src='images/spinalBefore.png' class="service-img"><br>
													<b>The pumping action of the table does two things:</b><br><br>
1. As the table pulls on your spine it slowly stretches your spine and increases the space between the two spinal bones (the disc space). This creates a
 negative pressure or vacuum in the disc which helps to suck the disc back inwards and away from the nerve that is being pinched. Although the amount 
 is very small each treatment, with consecutive treatments it creates more space for the nerve and decreases the size of the disc herniation.<br><br>
2. Secondly, the pumping action of the table sucks nutrients in and pushes nutrients out creating a nutrient exchange (imbibition). The increased level 
of nutrients in the disc allows the disc to have the nutrition it needs to speed up the healing process. Because discs don't have a large blood supply they 
do not get a lot of nutrients on their own. This is why most people don't just get better on their own, we typically cause as much damage to our discs in a 
day as we can heal with the natural imbibition. With spinal decompression we greatly increase the nutrients to the disc which provides the building blocks necessary
 for discs to heal more rapidly. Studies have shown that the disc space can increase 1-3mm over the treatment cycle that is provided. Although that seems a small
  amount it can have a large influence on the space needed to get pressure off of the sensitive nerves in the area.
<br><br>
												 

													<h3>Research on the effectiveness of Spinal Decompression:</h3>
													A recent clinical study of 219 patients has shown that spinal decompression therapy provided a resolution of symptoms
													 for 86% of the participants who completed their therapy, while 84% remained pain-free 90 days post-treatment.	<br><br>
													There are several tables that perform non-surgical decompression of the spine. The following results were obtained
													 from DRS/Inter-Discal Decompression (IDD) therapy, Vertebral-Axial Decompression and non-surgical Spinal Decompression Therapy.
													 Although the concept of non-surgical Spinal Decompression therapy is similar in the DRS/VAX-D, please note that each table is a
													  registered trademark and the following research may be specific to a specific decompression table/protocol employed.
													<br><br>

													<img src='images/spinalDecompression.jpeg' class="service-img"><br>
												 
													<h3>Clinical Trials:</h3>
													In a recent journal article in Orthopedic Technology Review titled Surgical Alternatives: Spinal Decompression, results 
													showed that 86% of the 219 patients who completed the therapy reported resolution of symptoms while 84% of patients remained
													 pain free 90 days post treatment. Physical examination findings showed improvement in 92% of the 219 patients, and remained 
													 intact in 89% of these patients 90 days after treatment.<br><br>
Another article in Journal of Neurological Research reported that vertebral axial [spinal] decompression was
 successful in 71% of the 778 cases". The success rate varied from 73% for patients with a single herniated disc. It was 72% for people with multiple herniated discs.<br><br>
The American Journal of Pain Management reported "good to excellent" relief in 86% of patients with herniated discs,
 with back pain and sciatica symptoms being relieved. Good to excellent results were also obtained in 75% of those with facet syndrome.<br><br>
A small non-randomized study in Anesthesiology News reported of the 23 patients who responded to therapy, 52% had a pain level of zero, 91% were 
able to resume their normal daily activities, and 87% were either working or were retired without having back pain as the cause of retirement.<br><br>
In a small study to determine the long-term effects of vertebral axial decompression, the following results were obtained: "Among 23 patients, 71% showed 
more than 50% reduction in pain immediately after treatment, and 86% showed a 50% or better pain reduction at four years. After four years, 52% of respondents
 reported a pain level of zero. Thus, pain relief not only improved but lasted. This pilot study shows great promise for long term relief and new pain management techniques.<br><br>
An interesting study at the Rio Grande Hospital, Department of Neurosurgery compared the effects of 20 treatment sessions vs. 10 treatment sessions on chronic 
low back pain sufferers. The group receiving 20 treatments of decompression therapy reported a 76.5% with complete remission and 19.6% with partial remission of 
pain and disability. The second group, receiving 10 treatments of decompression therapy, reported a 42.9% rate of remission and 24.1% with partial remission.
 Failure rate was only 3.9% for those receiving 20 treatment sessions while it was 32.9% for those receiving only 10 sessions. Remission was defined as 90% or 
 greater relief of pain, back to work without limitations, and abilities to carry out Activities of Daily Living (ADL's). Partial remission was defined as persistence 
 of some pain but ability to carry out most ADL's and return to work with some restriction of duties, depending on the occupation. Failure rate was defined as no change 
 in the level of pain and or/ADL.<br><br>
As you can see from the above referenced Clinical Trials, Spinal Decompression Therapy is an effective therapy for people experiencing Discogenic or Arthritic pain (pain arising from the disc or caused by various types of Spinal Arthritis). In addition, promising research suggests that the effects of Spinal Decompression Therapy can be a long-lasting solution to certain chronic back pain disorders. Although failure rates are relatively low, studies suggest that completion of prescribed treatments can reduce failure rates from 32.9% to 3.9%.

												<h2>K-Tape</h2>
												<p>
													KT Tape® is applied along muscles, ligaments, and tendons (soft tissue) to provide a lightweight, external support that helps you remain active while recovering from injuries.*
													<h3>HOW DOES IT WORK?</h3>
	
												When an area of the body is injured through impact or over-use, the lymphatic fluid builds up causing inflammation and 
												swelling. This accumulation of lymphatic fluids may cause increased pressure on muscles and tissue which can cause significant discomfort or pain*.<br><br>
												It is believed that when applied correctly, KT Tape lifts the skin, decompressing the layers of fascia, allowing for greater movement of lymphatic fluid which 
												transports white blood cells throughout the body and removes waste products, cellular debris, and bacteria.

												<h2>ART</h2>
												<img src='images/ARTatriumLogo.jpg' class="service-img"><br>
												<p>
													Active release technique (ART) treats your body’s soft tissue by combining manipulation and movement. The technique’s been around for more than 30 years.<br><br>
													ART entails identifying, isolating, and targeting the affected area to break up scar tissue. This promotes blood flow and faster healing of injuries. <br><br>
													It was first used by Dr. P. Michael Leahy, a chiropractor, to treat soft tissue disorders in elite athletes and has since been used to treat millions of people.<br><br>
													ART can be used to treat pain and other symptoms caused by injury or damage to:<br><br>
													<ul>
													<li>	Fascia. This is fibrous connective tissue that protects and supports muscles and organs throughout your body. Inflammation across a band of fascia tissue can cause extreme pain and stiffness. Plantar fasciitis is a common fascia tissue condition.</li>
													<li>	Major muscle groups. Strains and pulls from overuse or trauma can affect any of your major muscle groups. This includes muscles in your neck and shoulders, back, and hamstrings.</li>
													<li>	Tendons and ligaments. Tendons connect muscles to bone and ligaments connect bone to bone. Injury to either can cause pain and decrease range of motion.</li>
													</ul>

												<h2>Vestibular Rehabilitations </h2>
												<p>
													Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV), an inner ear problem, is the most common cause of vertigo. We can normally correct the condition in 1-3 treatments.<br><br>
Vestibular rehabilitation is a proven treatment for dizziness and balance problems and is highly effective for all age groups.<br><br>
The vestibular system includes the parts of your inner ear that sense your head position and movement, the nerve pathways that carry that information to your brain, and the parts of the brain that process it.<br><br>
The brain uses inputs from the vestibular system, visual system and your muscles and joints to maintain your balance, orientation, and the ability to see clearly when you move. <br><br>
Causes and symptoms of dizziness and balance issues:<br><br>
Vestibular issues can result from a variety of problems, including inner ear issues and infections, jaw injuries, neck or head trauma, infection, inflammation and certain brain-related issues, and diseases. <br><br>
Problems in any part of this complex system can result in dizziness, vertigo, unsteadiness and visual issues and associated nausea, vomiting, headaches, fatigue and poor concentration.<br><br>
<h3>How does vestibular rehabilitation work?</h3>
Vestibular rehabilitation is a research-based therapy that is proven to be effective for many different dizziness and balance conditions. <br><br>
We will help you learn about your condition and develop a customized treatment plan to maximize your body’s ability to reduce or eliminate symptoms. This may involve a combination of in-clinic sessions and techniques prescribed for you to work on at home.<br><br>
Treatments may include maneuvers to correct vertigo, techniques to help reduce or eliminate symptoms and improve focus while moving, balance training, hands-on treatments, diet, lifestyle and at-home exercises.<br><br>
At your initial appointment the therapist will discuss any medical history that relates to your condition, so please bring details of any health problems and past treatments. Our therapists will perform a thorough assessment to determine causes and contributing factors to your condition. Assessment findings and how the vestibular system works will be explained and a treatment plan will be recommended, if indicated. Your therapist will also explain when you can expect to see results.

												<h2>Pelvic Floor Physiotherapy</h2>
												<p>
													Pelvic floor physiotherapy help women rehabilitate their pelvic floor muscles. These muscles can be weakened by childbirth, surgery, heavy lifting, being overweight, 
													constipation or menopause. The pelvic floor muscles support the womb (uterus), bladder and bowel (colon), forming a 'sling' from the pubic bone at the front to the tailbone at the back.
													 If the muscles are weak, this can affect bladder and bowel control, resulting in incontinence (leakage) or prolapse. <br><br>
For other women, their pelvic floor muscles may be overactive; that is, they can switch on involuntarily when they should be relaxing. These women  need to learn to
 release their muscles. Overactivity can cause difficulty with having sex, emptying the bladder or bowels or using tampons.<br><br>
This could include exercises, biofeedback (electronic monitoring), and manual treatment of the muscles. Advice about daily activities and fitness, 
as well as good bladder and bowel habits, will be given. Functional training of the pelvic floor gets your muscles back working effectively when you need them. <br><br>
There is good evidence that shows that pelvic floor physiotherapy can help with urinary incontinence and prolapse and can lessen the effects of childbirth and menopause on
 the pelvic floor, says Jean Hailes pelvic floor physiotherapist Janetta Webb. A pelvic floor physiotherapist is an important part of the multi-disciplinary team managing bladder
  and bowel health, sexual difficulties and pelvic pain. Women should not have to put up with incontinence, pelvic pain or discomfort.

												<h2>Cupping Therapy</h2>
												<p>
													Hot cupping is an ancient form of alternative medicine in which a therapist puts special cups on your skin for a few minutes to create suction.
													 People get it for many purposes, including to help with pain, inflammation, blood flow, relaxation and well-being, and as a type of deep-tissue massage	</p>

												<h2>Hot stone massage</h2>
												<p>
													Combining hot stone protocols with a full body massage provides a very healing and effective experience.
													 The hot stones also expand blood vessels, which encourages blood flow throughout the body. The hot stones have a 
													 sedative effect that can relieve chronic pain, reduce stress and promote deep relaxation.<br><br>

A hot stone massage is a type of massage therapy. It’s used to help you relax and ease tense muscles and damaged soft tissues throughout your body.<br><br>
During a hot stone massage, smooth, flat, heated stones are placed on specific parts of your body. The stones are usually made of basalt, a type of 
volcanic rock that retains heat. According to the University of New Hampshire Health Services, hot massage stones are heated to between 130 and 145 degrees.

													<h2>Custom Crafted Orthotics</h2>
													<div class="row mt-5 pt-2">
															<div class="col-lg-6">
																	An orthotic is a supportive device which is placed inside footwear, to change the mechanical function of the foot. It works dynamically during weight-bearing activities like walking, running and standing. Ideally, it should provide full, custom and corrected arch contact so that the foot works in a biomechanically correct way. At Atrium Physiotherapy we offer Custom Crafted Orthotics, calibrated to flex for your weight and foot type.
